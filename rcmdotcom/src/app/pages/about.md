<center>Hello, I'm Ryan! üëã</center>

<br/>

I am a Software and Audio Engineer from Miami, Florida, and an alumnus of Florida International University where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. Shortly after graduation I started for The City of Pembroke Pines, FL but found myself spending my spare time learning about the cloud and teaching myself programming fundamentals. Spring of 2018 I decided to change course from my short-lived career in IT to pursue a career focused on Software Engineering by joining a cohort at [Ironhack's Miami campus](https://www.ironhack.com/us/miami).

<br/>

After graduating from Ironhack, I was hired as a Software Engineer at [CareCloud](https://www.carecloud.com/) starting my career testing and building next-generation Patient and Practice Management / Electronic Health Record applications for medical practices. During my time there I wore multiple hats as part of three evolving dev teams. I started by writing automated End to End test suites using Selenium, WebdriverIO, Cucumber/Gherkin, Mocha, and Chai. In a few months, I became solely responsible for writing and managing GraphQL API integration test suites using Jest, Frisby, and Joi. After working on the Automation team, I wrote Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) and HIPPA compliant middleware using Golang for a subscription-based GraphQL and Express micro-service architecture. Then I started working on the Front-End/UX team, translating the elegant designs of our designers into clean, functional, workflow-driven user interfaces for a fluid Patient-Practitioner experience using React and GraphQL.

<br/>

Following CareCloud's acquisition by MTBC, I started working as a Software Engineering Consultant for a small development agency in Ft. Lauderdale, focused on building mobile and web applications for clients and first-time founders looking to launch their MVP.

<br/>

Today, I am a proud founding team member of [Sommsation](https://www.sommsation.com/) üç∑, a wine experience technology platform designed to revolutionize the way people share experiences over wine.

<br/>

I am fascinated by the technologies and the people behind the services and applications we interface with day to day. I continue to stay up to date by teaching myself new tech and best practices by using online resources including Lynda/LinkedIn Learning, Scrimba, FreeCodeCamp, FrontEndMasters, Udemy, Egghead.io, and Youtube of course.

<br/>

I'm a self-taught sound designer, audio engineer, disk jockey, and record collector with a deep interest in podcasts as a creative digital medium
